    "**INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The gaming industry is still expanding at an unparalleled rate, making significant contributions to the world of entertainment. According to recent statistics, this industry is seeing significant economic consequences, with revenue rising to all-time highs [1]. But the growing market also presents difficulties, especially when it comes to preserving player satisfaction in the face of growing game diversity. The challenges of meeting a variety of player expectations have highlighted the need for creative game improvement techniques [2].                       \n",
    "\n",
    "User reviews have become an essential component of player feedback in tackling the issues facing the rapidly growing gaming industry. Studies have demonstrated that evaluations give developers a direct route to the experiences and preferences of customers, giving them crucial insights [3,4,5]. Particularly common on digital platforms that compile user interactions and opinions is this immediate feedback option. Of them, **Steam** (https://store.steampowered.com/about/) is among the most well-known video game marketplaces, with a large library and a vibrant community. Its significant user base contributes to a diverse and comprehensive collection of reviews, making Steam an ideal environment for mining and analyzing player feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research intends to create a comprehensive analytical framework for mining and understanding user evaluations on websites such as **Steam**, taking these factors into account. This will help game producers improve their products to better suit players' varied needs and will also contribute to the larger conversation about how to improve customer satisfaction in the ever-changing gaming industry. Our ultimate objective is to shorten the gap between player expectations and game development in order to provide a more enjoyable and engaging gaming experience for all players."

    "**DESCRIPTION AND MOTIVATION OF APPROACHES**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we apply three core NLP strategies: \n",
    "- Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC)\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Topic analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "NERC helps identify and categorize key entities within text data, such as names of games, characters, or features, into predefined categories[12]. This NLP technique is crucial for structuring unstructured data[11]. In our project, NERC serves to pinpoint specific game elements mentioned in user reviews, aiding in the contextual analysis of feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis assesses the emotional content of sentences and allows us to classify them as neutral, positive, or negative[12,13]. This procedure is essential to comprehending the general attitude of players toward different components of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, topic analysis helps find recurrent patterns within user evaluations by extracting themes or concepts from vast amounts of text[14]. Using this method, we can identify common problems or remarks that might not be immediately apparent."

    "**DATA CLEANING - PHASE 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data cleaning procedure started with the removal of duplicate entries to guarantee the originality of each review before standardizing the text by changing all of the review content to lowercase, which made text analysis chores easier in the future. Consequently, we removed any dataset entries that were missing important information. This included reviews without text or application names.We further de-cluttered the dataset by removing columns that had no impact on our project's goals, such as unnecessary timestamps and identities, and concentrating only on information that was relevant to the main analysis. In order to ensure consistency and relevance throughout the dataset, we focused on English-language reviews in order to conform to the linguistic scope of our study. The language column was then removed as well because it was implied. \n",
    "\n",
    "The finalization of the first cleaning phase process involved more general edits to the datasets, which resulted also in a substantially smaller one. "
